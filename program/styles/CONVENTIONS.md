# Convention of classes, variables and identifiers for CSS files.
---
#### Please drop your ideas [here](#Ideas).
---
# Required Features
- Color themes
- Classes/components names
- features for single class

# How it works

Class names and identifiers are provided by the application. however, their design is generated by the user.

For example:

navbar is the name used in any css file generated by anura, but according to the file (that was created by a user).

in other words, we give to the user a name and they can do everything whit this name.

### Users styles

Each member can create their own styles and use other member's styles. The idea is to upload the files to the webapp, and access them with the CLI application. But the names styles always must be the same. this so that the application can access these styles and create html structures without having problems when calling classes
