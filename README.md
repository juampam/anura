## Usage (Testing)

*Note: This program is designed to run on GNU/Linux, however, to use the library is not necesary install the program, just need use the published styles*

## The Goal

Create a library with many classes, easy to combine to create elements with very specific characteristics. The program must be able to create any new configuration, classes and components. It is designed to work in community, each user can create their own configurations and share them with the rest. the main settings to consider are the components. A component is a collection of classes, designed to create specific parts that require them. That allow them to be called easily, copying them or calling them by CLI. We hope to create a tool to create these components following standard parameters, to avoid errors where they are used.

In short, a library that grows with your community and allows you to easily and quickly create each class that anyone considers necessary.
